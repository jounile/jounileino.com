German-Finnish Business Forum

I rarely meet fellow Finns in Stuttgart but this week there was a real invasion with German-Finnish Business Forum. Great networking around the Future of Automotive topic, supplier pitches and demos.

On the first day 7.10.2021 a Get-together was held at the Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart. After a opening ceremony some automotive suppliers gave a short introduction to their businesses. Participants could freely visit the museum and have drinks while connecting with other visitors. Relaxed atmosphere at the museum set the tone for the next day.

Second day took place at the Wagenhalle where panel discussions, pitches, demos and presentations took place.

Opening words were delivered by Winfried Kretschmann (Minister-President of the State of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg) via a video greeting.

Ville Skinnari, Minister for Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade, Finland presented his views about the future of German-Finnish collaboration in the automotive sector.
